# Building a Blockchain from scratch in Rust

This is based in the udemy course
["Blockchain A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build Your First Blockchain"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/).
Instead of take the course path, and make it in python, I decided to do it in Rust with actix-web.
